The purpose of this script is to give you a running example of the methodology presented in:
    [1] D.V. Pombo, H.W. Bindner, S.V. Spataru, P. Sørensen, P. Bacher, 
    Increasing the Accuracy of Hourly Multi-Output Solar Power Forecast with 
    Physics-Informed Machine Learning, Solar Energy. In Press.
    
It should run without errors simply by placing all the files in the same location.
We have checked the hdf5 file (the actual dataset) compatibility with both Python and R. 
The lincensing of this work is pretty chill, just give credit: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

How to use the first time:
    1- Put all the files in the same folder and click run. If you get the message "Done!" in the console that is it.
    2- If it didn't work:
        a) Check the dependencies: 
            Python 3.8.10
            Pandas 1.2.4
            Numpy 1.19.5
            Matplotlib 3.4.2
            Scikit-Learn 0.24.2
            Keras 2.5.0
            TensorFlow 2.5.0
        b) If that didn't solve it... You have a problem my friend ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
    
How to use the second and subsequent times:
    1- Go to section: "Control the Script"
        In the dictionary called Control_Var you can modify different values, like the horizon to forecast,
        the division between training, validation and testing, what is the metric to be predicted, which 
        should be used as extrinsic features, etc.
    2- Go to section: Define Machine Learning Configuration and Hyperparameters
        You can use those dictionaries to define different topologies for the 5 ML methods covered in [1]
        However, be careful with ANN, they have a particular shape, you cant control each layer's position
        from there. But you can edit that yourself.
    3- After setting those parameters just run it. Take into account the size of the data, it might take a while.
    4- If you found this useful, and want to send some kudos, do so.

DISCLAIMERS:
1- I was using a regular PC only for coding, models were run in an HPC.
2- There are better ways to configure the ML-models, have fun playing with it.
3- SVM will take for ever if run in this way for the whole set. An alternative formulation is -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31681373/making-svm-run-faster-in-python     
4- I put together the dataset and this scripts in one day, so do not expect them to be pretty or 100% error free.
